# Friendship_Paradox
C++ program that tests the friendship paradox using two methods.

The friendship paradox states that, on average, the friends of any given person have more friends than the person himself. This program analyzes text files with a data set representing friend relationships on social media sites to evaluate the validity of the friendship paradox.

The format of the file is rows with two numbers that represent the person and their friend. Frienship relationships are interpreted as symmetric (i.e. if person 1 is friends with person 2, person 2 is also friends with person 1).

The program uses an adjacency list and calculates averages to determine whether or not the frienship paradox holds true for the provided dataset.
